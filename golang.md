In the projects, in which I work, it comes up that I am asked what I recommend for xyz. So that I don't forget half of the information, I'll started to collect it thematically and in a more or less structured way and publish it here.
Here my hopefully helpful resources for the Go language.

Not my code, should help to debug, will we need a 49" monitor for debugging or two of them side by side in future? A healthy balance would suit us all.
